/**
 * @file        main.c
 * @brief       I2C Loopback Example
 * @details     This example uses the I2C Master to read/write from/to the I2C Slave. For
 *              this example you must connect P0.12 to P0.18 (SCL) and P0.13 to P0.19 (SCL). The Master
 *              will use P0.12 and P0.13. The Slave will use P0.18 and P0.19. You must also
 *              connect the pull-up jumpers (JP23 and JP24) to the proper I/O voltage.
 *              Refer to JP27 to determine the I/O voltage.
 * @note        Other devices on the EvKit will be using the same bus. This example cannot be combined with
 *              a PMIC or bluetooth example because the I2C Slave uses GPIO pins for those devices.
