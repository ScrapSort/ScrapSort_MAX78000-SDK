# The MAX78000 SDK

Refer to [Getting Started with the MAX78000 Evaluation Kit](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/blob/master/MAX78000_Evaluation_Kit/README.md) for details on using the SDK.

## Release Notes

May 21, 2020
* Initial Release

June 7, 2020
* In the Documentation folder of the SDK, added a MAX78000.html file which serves as a single source for all MAX78000 related documents.
* Added a README.md file for each example.
* Added automatic configuration of ADC GPIO pins.
* Fixed minor GPIO peripheral library bugs.
* Added optional configuration of TMR GPIO pins.

## Known Issues & Upcoming Features

* Debug support for the RISC-V core has not been validated.
* There will be more examples coming in a future release.
* The Eclipse projects show errors and warnings indicating there are unresolved references.  However, the projects still build and run correctly.
* When uninstalling the SDK using the maintenance tool, an error will occur referring to the fstab file.  This error can be ignored - the uninstall will still complete.
