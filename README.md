## Known Issues & Upcoming Features

* Debug support for the RISC-V core has not been validated.
* There will be more examples coming in a future release.
* The Eclipse projects show errors and warnings indicating there are unresolved references.  However, the projects still build and run correctly.
* When uninstalling the SDK using the maintenance tool, an error will occur referring to the fstab file.  This error can be ignored - the uninstall will still complete.
* The MXC_Delay library is not complete when building for the RISC-V core.
